### Short Description

During a conversation, speakers tend to converge towards each other. This phenomenon is called speech convergence. Aim of this project is to find what happens in the participants brain during speech convergence.

### Theory

### Goal

### Experiment

### Steps

The steps are -
* Quantifying speech convergence and mark the time points in the conversation.
* Using the markers we group the corresponding brain recordings and find some neural markers.

### Conclusion

By this work, we provide evidence that mutual adaptation of speech phonetic targets, correlates with specific alpha and beta oscillatory dynamics. Alpha and beta oscillatory dynamics may index the coordination of the “when” as well as the “how” speech interaction takes place, reinforcing the suggestion that perception and production processes are highly interdependent and co-constructed during a conversation.
